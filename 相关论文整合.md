## Semantics-Based Obfuscation-Resilient Binary Code Similarity Comparison with Applications to Software and Algorithm Plagiarism Detection
（IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering 2017）

- [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823022&tag=1) </br>

__Abstract__: Existing code similarity comparison methods, whether source or binary code based, are mostly not resilient to obfuscations. Identifying similar or identical code fragments among programs is very important in some applications. For example, one application is to detect illegal code reuse. In the code theft cases, emerging obfuscation techniques have made automated detection increasingly difficult. Another application is to identify cryptographic algorithms which are widely employed by modern malware to circumvent detection, hide network communications, and protect payloads among other purposes. Due to diverse coding styles and high programming flexibility, different implementation of the same algorithm may appear very distinct, causing automatic detection to be very hard, let alone code obfuscations are sometimes applied. In this paper, we propose a binary-oriented, obfuscation-resilient binary code similarity comparison method based on a new concept, longest common subsequence of semantically equivalent basic blocks , which combines rigorous program semantics with longest common subsequence based fuzzy matching. We model the semantics of a basic block by a set of symbolic formulas representing the input-output relations of the block. This way, the semantic equivalence (and similarity) of two blocks can be checked by a theorem prover. We then model the semantic similarity of two paths using the longest common subsequence with basic blocks as elements. This novel combination has resulted in strong resiliency to code obfuscation. We have developed a prototype. The experimental results show that our method can be applied to software plagiarism and algorithm detection, and is effective and practical to analyze real-world software.

## Wire -- A Formal Intermediate Language for Binary Analysis (中间语言)
(2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications)

- [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6296015)

__Abstract__:Wire is a intermediate language to enable static program analysis on low level objects such as native executables. It has practical benefit in analysing the structure and semantics of malware, or for identifying software defects in closed source software. In this paper we describe how an executable program is disassembled and translated to the Wire intermediate language. We define the formal syntax and operational semantics of Wire and discuss our justifications for its language features. We use Wire in our previous work Malwise, a malware variant detection system. We also examine applications for when a formally defined intermediate language is given. Our results include showing the semantic equivalence between obfuscated and non obfuscated code samples. These examples stem from the obfuscations commonly used by malware.

## Efficient features for function matching between binary executables
( 2018 IEEE 25th International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER))

__Abstract__:Binary diffing is the process of reverse engineering two programs, when source code is not available, in order to study their syntactic and semantic differences. For large programs, binary diffing can be performed by function matching which, in turn, is reduced to a graph isomorphism problem between the compared programs' CFGs (Control Flow Graphs) and/or CGs (Call Graphs). In this paper we provide a set of carefully chosen features, extracted from a binary's CG and CFG, which can be used by BinDiff algorithm variants to, first, build a set of initial exact matches with minimal false positives (by scanning for unique perfect matches) and, second, propagate approximate matching information using, for example, a nearest-neighbor scheme. Furthermore, we investigate the benefits of applying Markov lumping techniques to function CFGs (to our knowledge, this technique has not been previously studied). The proposed function features are evaluated in a series of experiments on various versions of the Linux kernel (Intel64), the OpenSSH server (Intel64) and Firefox's xul.dll (IA-32). Our prototype system is also compared to Diaphora, the current state-of-the-art binary diffing software.

## Towards reverse engineering of intermediate code for documentation generators
(2017 IEEE 24th International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER))

- [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7884673)

__Abstract__:We describe the motivation, approach and first experience from reverse engineering Common Intermediate Language (CIL) for the purpose of documentation generation. Instead of parsing source code implemented in different programming languages, we reverse engineer CIL code and thereby enable documentation generation for all programming languages that can be compiled into CIL code. Initial results show that we are able to generate documents in the same quality as compared to directly analyzing source code. To overcome initial shortcomings we introduce additional preprocessing in form of AST refactoring which is not required when analyzing source code.

## The ruby intermediate language
（2009 SPLASHSystems, Programming, and Applications ）

- [paper](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1650000/1640148/p89-furr.pdf?ip=211.64.159.13&id=1640148&acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&key=BF85BBA5741FDC6E%2E62F7C54E1C56C642%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&__acm__=1571194995_d31de164d14d411531486d87c25b9bca)

__Abstract__:Ruby is a popular, dynamic scripting language that aims to "feel natural to programmers" and give users the "freedom to choose" among many different ways of doing the same thing. While this arguably makes programming in Ruby easier, it makes it hard to build analysis and transformation tools that operate on Ruby source code. In this paper, we present the Ruby Intermediate Language (RIL), a Ruby front-end and intermediate representation that addresses these. RIL includes an extensible GLR parser for Ruby, and an automatic translation into an easy-to-analyze intermediate form. This translation eliminates redundant language constructs, unravels the often subtle ordering among side effecting operations, and makes implicit interpreter operations explicit. We also describe several additional useful features of RIL, such as a dynamic instrumentation library for profiling source code and a dataflow analysis engine. We demonstrate the usefulness of RIL by presenting a static and dynamic analysis to eliminate null pointer errors in Ruby programs. We hope that RIL's features will enable others to more easily build analysis tools for Ruby, and that our design will inspire the of similar frameworks for other dynamic languages.

## CIL: Intermediate Language and Tools for Analysis and Transformation of C Programs
(2002 LNCS: Lecture Notes In Computer Science)

- [paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=727796)

__Abstract__:This paper describes the C Intermediate Language: a high-level representation along with a set of tools that permit easy analysis and source-to-source transformation of C programs.Compared to C, CIL has fewer constructs. It breaks down certain complicated constructs of C into simpler ones, and thus it works at a lower level than abstract-syntax trees. But CIL is also more high-level than typical intermediate languages (e.g., three-address code) designed for compilation. As a result, what we have is a representation that makes it easy to analyze and manipulate C programs, and emit them in a form that resembles the original source. Moreover, it comes with a front-end that translates to CIL not only ANSI C programs but also those using Microsoft C or GNU C extensions.We describe the structure of CIL with a focus on how it disambiguates those features of C that we found to be most confusing for program analysis and transformation. We also describe a whole-program merger based on structural type equality, allowing a complete project to be viewed as a single compilation unit. As a representative application of CIL, we show a transformation aimed at making code immune to stack-smashing attacks. We are currently using CIL as part of a system that analyzes and instruments C programs with run-time checks to ensure type safety. CIL has served us very well in this project, and we believe it can usefully be applied in other situations as well.

## Program Characterization Using Runtime Values and Its Application to Software Plagiarism Detection
（2015 IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering）

- [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7076635)

__Abstract__:Illegal code reuse has become a serious threat to the software community. Identifying similar or identical code fragments becomes much more challenging in code theft cases where plagiarizers can use various automated code transformation or obfuscation techniques to hide stolen code from being detected. Previous works in this field are largely limited in that (i) most of them cannot handle advanced obfuscation techniques, and (ii) the methods based on source code analysis are not practical since the source code of suspicious programs typically cannot be obtained until strong evidences have been collected. Based on the observation that some critical runtime values of a program are hard to be replaced or eliminated by semantics-preserving transformation techniques, we introduce a novel approach to dynamic characterization of executable programs. Leveraging such invariant values, our technique is resilient to various control and data obfuscation techniques. We show how the values can be extracted and refined to expose the critical values and how we can apply this runtime property to help solve problems in software plagiarism detection. We have implemented a prototype with a dynamic taint analyzer atop a generic processor emulator. Our value-based plagiarism detection method (VaPD) uses the longest common subsequence based similarity measuring algorithms to check whether two code fragments belong to the same lineage. We evaluate our proposed method through a set of real-world automated obfuscators. Our experimental results show that the value-based method successfully discriminates 34 plagiarisms obfuscated by SandMark, plagiarisms heavily obfuscated by KlassMaster, programs obfuscated by Thicket, and executables obfuscated by Loco/Diablo.

## A novel method to find out the similarity between source codes
（2016 IEEE Uttar Pradesh Section International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Electronics Engineering (UPCON)）

- [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7894676&tag=1)

__Abstract__: Plagiarism is not only found in the academic work but also in the industries dealing with software designing. Plagiarism is becoming a serious problem for academician community. Academics can detect similarity of source code files with the help of plagiarism detection tools. In this paper we present JSIM (Java Similarity) tool to find out the Similarity between Source codes. Two source codes will be matched at function's level or method's level with the help of JSIM. With the help of JSIM tool teachers can find the similarity between source code and according to the similarity, teacher can easily give marks to the students in an assignment of programming subject.

## An AST-based Code Plagiarism Detection Algorithm
(2015 10th International Conference on Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications (BWCCA))

- [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7424821)

__Abstract__: In modern software engineering, software plagiarism is widespread and uncurbed, developing plagiarism detection methods is imperative. Popular technologies of software plagiarism detection are mostly based on text, token and syntax tree. Among these plagiarism detection technologies, tree-based plagiarism detection technology can effectively detect the code which cannot be detected by the other two kinds of technologies. In this paper, we propose a more effective plagiarism detection algorithm based on abstract syntax tree (AST) by computing the hash values of the syntax tree nodes, and comparing them. In order to implement the algorithm more effectively, special measurement is taken to reduce the error rate when calculating the hash values of operations, especially the arithmetic operations like subtraction and division. Results of the test showed that the measurement is reliable and necessary. It performs well in the code comparison field, and is helpful in the area of protecting source code's copyright.

## Program plagiarism detection with dynamic structure
 (2018 7th International Symposium on Next Generation Electronics (ISNE))

- [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8394758)

__Abstact__: The paper proposed an automated program alignment system, SPDS (Structure Plagiarism Detection System) which allows users to determine whether there is any possibility of plagiarism among them. The dynamic slicing was used to analyze the behavior of the function, combining the combinatorial decision coverage to generate valid inputs, and convert the results to the program dependence graph to calculate the similarity of the behavioral part. The similarity of the variable and comment are calculated by cosine similarity and winnowing algorithm. Finally, the weight of each similarity can be adjusted by the user or decided by the system depends on the different situation. The experimental result shows that our proposed system can have better similarity measure result than JPlag, MOSS, and SPD.

## CPLAG: Efficient plagiarism detection using bitwise operations
(2017 Tenth International Conference on Contemporary Computing (IC3))

- [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8284313)

__Abstract__: Source code plagiarism in an academic environment is a serious concern of faculties. The paper presents an efficient plagiarism detection tool, CPLAG, for C programming language codes. The tool assesses the structure of the C programs based on a set of attributes and performs a binary encoding of the C code statements. Subsequently, it utilizes computationally inexpensive bitwise operations to detect similarity between the given C programs. The design of CPLAG considers the commonly used techniques to avoid detection of plagiarism for delivering an efficient performance. Moreover, it avoids the extensive computations as used by existing tools for plagiarism detection. Experiment results indicate that CPLAG can detect plagiarism with accuracy. The tool finds application in academic institutions for fair and efficient automatic evaluation and grading of programming assignments.

## A state of art on source code plagiarism detection
(2016 2nd International Conference on Next Generation Computing Technologies (NGCT))

- [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7877421)

__Abstract__: Plagiarism is becoming a serious problem for intellectual community. The detection of plagiarism at various levels is a major issue. The complexity of the problem increases when we are finding the plagiarism in the source codes that may be in the same language or they have been transformed into other languages. This type of plagiarism is found not only in the academic works but also in the industries dealing with software designing. The major issue with the source code plagiarism is that different programming languages may have different syntax. In this paper the authors will explain various techniques and algorithms to discover the plagiarism in source code. So organization or academic institution can simply discover plagiarism in source code using these techniques. The authors will differentiate among these given techniques of plagiarism to discover how one technique is conflicting with the other.

## An abstract method linearization for detecting source code plagiarism in object-oriented environment
(2017 8th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Science (ICSESS))

- [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8342863)

__Abstract__: Despite the fact that plagiarizing source code is a trivial task for most CS students, detecting such unethical behavior requires a considerable amount of effort. Thus, several plagiarism detection systems were developed to handle such issue. This paper extends Karnalim's work, a low-level approach for detecting Java source code plagiarism, by incorporating abstract method linearization. Such extension is incorporated to enhance the accuracy of low-level approach in term of detecting plagiarism in object-oriented environment. According to our evaluation, which was conducted based on 23 design-pattern source code pairs, our extended low-level approach is more effective than state-of-the-art and Karnalim's approach. On the one hand, when compared to state-of-the-art approach, our approach can generate less coincidental similarities and provide more accurate result. On the other hand, when compared to Karnalim's approach, our approach, at some extent, can generate higher similarity when simple abstract method invocation is incorporated.

## Detecting source code plagiarism on introductory programming course assignments using a bytecode approach
(2016 International Conference on Information & Communication Technology and Systems (ICTS))

- [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7910274)

__Abstract__: Even though there are various source code plagiarism detection approaches, most of them only concern with low-level plagiarism attack with an assumption that plagiarism is only conducted by students who are not proficient in programming. However, plagiarism is often conducted not only due to student incapability, but also because of bad time management. Thus, high-level plagiarism attack should be detected and evaluated. This paper proposes source code plagiarism detection approach which can detect most introductory-programming-course plagiarism attacks at any level by utilizing low-level instructions instead of source code tokens. Several mechanisms are also introduced to improve its effectiveness such as instruction generalization, instruction reinterpretation, method-based comparison, and method linearization. Since low-level instruction is a language-dependent feature, Java is selected as target programming language with bytecode as its low-level instruction. Based on evaluation, it can be concluded that our approach is more effective to detect most plagiarism attack types than raw source code approach on introductory programming course. This evaluation is based on plagiarism attack types that are collected through controlled experiment.
